This removes the item-switching behaviour of animal armour described in [MC-273300](https://bugs-legacy.mojang.com/browse/MC-273300).

This is useful for players of servers which rely on horse armour to display custom models for cosmetic or utility purposes. Without this mod, right clicking with one of these in your offhand causes unintentional switching which gets really annoying more than anything.

This mod does nothing besides fixing this faulty "use" behaviour on the following:
- Leather horse armour
- Iron horse armour
- Gold horse armour
- Diamond horse armour
- Wolf armour

## Usage
Simply drag the mod into your mods folder or add it as a custom mod to your client of choice. Compatible with any modpack, feather or lunar client.
